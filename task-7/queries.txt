Window Function
-> it performs aggregate operations on group of rows, but they produce a result for each row.
unlike aggregate functions they produce result for each row rather than collapsing into single row.
-> it creates a Window -> groups

syntax:
function_name() OVER (
   PARTITION BY column   -- like GROUP BY (optional)
   ORDER BY column       -- ranking/order logic
)

OVER() -> creates a Window/group.
